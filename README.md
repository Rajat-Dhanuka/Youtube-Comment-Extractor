# Youtube-Comment-Extractor
This script will grab all comments and replies from a given video link, arrange them in an orderly fashion, and return a CSV file (containing commenterâ€™s name, comments, likes, etc.). This is a great way to keep track of feedback or simply get an overview of the conversation around a certain video.
